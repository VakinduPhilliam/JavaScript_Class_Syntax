# JavaScript_Class_Syntax
JavaScript examples to demonstrate the use of the JS Class function method.

The following scripts demonstrate how to use the JavaScript class method.
The “class” construct allows developers to define prototype-based classes with a clean, nice-looking syntax.
JavaScript classes have a default constructor() {}.
If there’s no constructor in the class construct, then an empty function is generated, same as if we had written constructor() {}.
JavaScript classes always use strict.
All code inside the class construct is automatically in strict mode.
Also important to note is that methods in a JavaScript classes do not have a comma between them.
